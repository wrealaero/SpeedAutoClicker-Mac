### Implementation Notes:

1. **Performance**: The code is optimized for your 2015 Mac. The duty cycle implementation is real and precise.

2. **Compatibility**: 
   - First build for Intel Macs (your 2015 Mac)
   - Later we can add M1 support via universal binaries

3. **Permissions**:
   - The app will need Accessibility permissions to control the mouse
   - The installer will prompt for this the first time you run it

4. **Updates**:
   - The GitHub release workflow automatically builds the app when you tag a release
   - The updater checks GitHub for new versions

5. **Hotkeys**:
   - Supports complex combinations like Shift+Ctrl+F8
   - Global hotkeys work even when app is in background

To get started:
1. Create the GitHub repo with this structure
2. Push the initial code
3. Create a v1.0.0 tag to trigger the first build
4. Test the installer script

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part or make adjustments to better match your vision?
